# alx-project-0x00-setup

This project is a simple Next.js (Pages Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS setup
used for learning basic routing, components, and typing in React/Next.js.

Follow the ALX instructions to scaffold with:

    npx create-next-app@latest alx-project-0x00 --typescript

Then replace the files in your generated project with the ones from this archive
(where paths match). You can also use this archive directly as a minimal project:

    npm install
    npm run dev -- -p 3000
